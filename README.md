The To-Do List app is a web application designed to help users organize their tasks efficiently. It allows users to add, update, and delete tasks as needed. In my project I used pug, css and javaScript. So as to run a program, please firstly intall node_modules folder.

Users can add new tasks to their list by filling out a form. The form includes fields for task title, due date, and description. Once submitted, the task is added to the list for future reference.

All tasks are displayed in a list format, showing the task title, due date, and description. Users can easily view all their tasks.

Registered tasks can be updated as needed. An edit option is available, allowing users to modify existing task details such as the title, due date, and description.

Users have the option to delete tasks from their list if they no longer need them. A delete function is provided, enabling users to remove tasks from the database.

There are several folder included in the root of the project: (controllers, database, public, routes, services, validatiors, views).
Controllers folder contains files for rendering pug files. Database folder stores the data.json file for storing task data. Public folder includes static assets like CSS files and client-side JavaScript files. Routes folder defines application routes and associated controller methods. Services folder contains JavaScript file for inserting new task data or updating existing data. Views folder contains Pug template files defining the layout and structure of web pages.
There is one root JavaScript file (index.js) for starting the server and configuring middleware.
